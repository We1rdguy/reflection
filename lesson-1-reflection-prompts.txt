How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It worked well when I can compare the difference between two version by using FC command.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    It is better for me to focus on development.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The advantage if Git is that I could save the old version instead of writing it over. Overwriting docs is more efficiency, but there are more chances to have a bug in that.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In version control, sometimes there are files connected to each other. So that, it is easier to management version by saving multiple files in one commit.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is for seeing the history written by author.
    git diff is for seeing the difference between two version 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    When I can easily get back to old version, it makes me more confident to exlplore.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Try some little task of git.
